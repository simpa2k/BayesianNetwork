# BayesianNetwork

A first shot at implementing a Bayesian network. The functionality provided here is mostly a wrapper around a graph structure without
any useful connection to the na√Øve Bayes classifier. This repository is mostly kept as a reference for myself. For a better example
of a Bayesian network, see the repository bayes.
